            <p>Hi there, I'm Brian, currently living in Den Haag and as said, before I applied at Codaisseur,
              I was working in the offshore industry. What am I doing here you ask? Well, the offshore industry is on a massive downturn and you can't keep sitting 'at home' forever!
              When my rig got <abbr title="Cold Layup (coldstacked) is the practice of mooring the vessel with only watchmen and not running systems during the layup period.">coldstacked</abbr>,
              and I was made redundant after 13 years, I first decided to travel around the world. Visited countries like
              USA, Thailand, Spain, Greece, Malaysia and more. But after a great spell, reality kicked in, it was time to get back to business.</p>

            <p>As I was travelling, and time was passing by, I started to explore other options outside of the offshore industry. Switch careers...
              It took me a long time, but in the end, I couldn't find an industry more booming and more interesting than the current technology industry, and web development really caught my eye!

            <p>So eventually I found Codaisseur and it really got me excited thinking about a different career path.
               Fast forward another few months and here I am, anxious to start!

            <p>In my free time I enjoy a lot of different hobbies, travelling, playing squash, both live and online poker, driving around on my motorbike and many others.
